moving_average_crossover

!!!WIP!!!

THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NOT ABOUT THE TRADING STRATEGY!
 
simple ma crossover backtest on crypto data.

The objective is not to maximize return but to show the limits of the infrastructure that the algo is running on.

I use crypto as a data source because it is freely available. The data ingestion can be replaced with other data anytime.
